Welcome to open-moldyn's documentation!
=======================================

Presentation
============

Open-moldyn is the result of an internship project at
the IPR (*Institut de Physique de Rennes*)
aiming at creating an (hopefully) fast and easy to
use 2D molecular dynamics simulation tool with python.

This tool features a GUI (graphical interface) and is
meant to be installed with pip (as every respectable
python packages should be).
